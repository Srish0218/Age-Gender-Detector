# Age-Gender-Detector

Real-time age and gender recognition using pre-trained Caffe models in Python with OpenCV is certainly possible. Caffe is a deep learning framework that allows you to train and deploy convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It provides a large number of pre-trained models that you can use for various computer vision tasks, including age and gender recognition.

Here's a general outline of the steps involved in implementing real-time age and gender recognition using pre-trained Caffe models with Python and OpenCV:

Install the necessary dependencies:

Install Python (if not already installed).
Install OpenCV: You can install it using pip with the command pip install opencv-python.
Install Caffe: Follow the instructions provided in the Caffe documentation (https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) to install Caffe on your system.
Download the pre-trained models:

Caffe provides pre-trained models for age and gender recognition. You can download the age and gender models from the Caffe Model Zoo (https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/model_zoo.html).
Set up the Python script:

Import the necessary libraries: OpenCV, numpy, and caffe.
Load the pre-trained models: Load both the age and gender models using caffe.Net.
Set up the video capture: Use OpenCV's VideoCapture to access the webcam or a video file.
Set up the face detection: Use OpenCV's Haar cascades or a deep learning-based face detector (such as OpenCV's DNN module with a pre-trained face detection model).
Define the age and gender classes: Create a list of age and gender classes to map the model outputs.
Implement the real-time recognition loop:

Read the video frames from the webcam or video file.
Perform face detection: Detect faces in the frames using the face detection model.
Preprocess the detected face: Crop and resize the face region to match the input size expected by the age and gender models.
Perform age and gender classification: Pass the preprocessed face through the age and gender models to obtain the predictions.
Display the results: Draw bounding boxes around the detected faces and display the predicted age and gender labels on the frames.
Run the script: Execute the Python script to start the real-time age and gender recognition.

It's worth noting that the accuracy of age and gender recognition models can vary depending on the dataset they were trained on and their specific architecture. You may need to fine-tune or retrain the models on your own dataset to achieve better results, if necessary.

Remember to refer to the documentation and resources provided by Caffe and OpenCV for more detailed information on using pre-trained models and implementing computer vision tasks.
