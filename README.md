# Face Age and Gender Estimation

This project uses OpenCV to perform face detection and estimate the age and gender of the detected faces in a video feed from a webcam.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-age-gender-estimation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy code
cd face-age-gender-estimation
Run the script:

shell
Copy code
python age_gender_estimation.py
The script will open a window displaying the video feed from your webcam. It will detect faces in each frame and overlay the predicted age and gender on the faces.

Press the 'q' key to quit the script and close the window.

Customization
You can modify the script to suit your needs:

Adjust the confidence threshold for face detection by changing the value in the if confidence > 0.7 condition.
Customize the labels for age and gender by modifying the ageList and genderList arrays.
Experiment with different pre-trained models for face detection, age estimation, and gender classification.
